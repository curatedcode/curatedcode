# Hey, I'm Zack

- Mostly **TypeScript**, **React**, **Javascript** and dabbling in **C**

I have a passion for open source and the amazing things that collaborators have created. I am currently working on [Applii](https://github.com/curatedcode/applii-tracker), an open-source and feature rich job application tracker. I am also interested in exploring AI/ML in my spare time, as it's awesome to see the incredible advances being made.
